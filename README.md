Payment Gateway system using the Factory Design Pattern in Java. The goal is to decouple the payment process from the specific payment method (like Credit Card, UPI, or Bank Transfer) and use a factory to create the appropriate payment method at runtime.

--------------
Summary of When to Use the Factory Pattern:

1. Centralize object creation logic.

2. Decouple client code from concrete implementations.

3. Manage complex object creation logic.

4. Extend the system easily by introducing new object types.

5. Dynamically determine which object to create at runtime.

6. Manage object creation for resource-intensive or restricted objects.

-----------------------

Steps followed -

Step 1: Create a common interface for all payment methods.

Step 2: Implement concrete classes for each payment method.

Step 3: Create a factory class to generate the appropriate payment object.

Step 4. Implement the PaymentGateway Class

Setp 5: Client Code (Main Class)

----------------------

Using the Factory Pattern makes your code more flexible, maintainable, and scalable, especially when working with applications that evolve over time.
